## Day 5: Understanding Binary

Welcome to Day 5! Today, we'll explore the fundamental concept of binary, the language of computers. Understanding binary is crucial for grasping how computers process and store data.

### What is Binary?

Binary is a base-2 numeral system that uses only two digits: 0 and 1. These digits are called bits. In contrast, the decimal system (which we use in everyday life) is a base-10 system that uses ten digits, 0 through 9.

#### Why Do Computers Use Binary?

Computers use binary because they are built from electronic components that have two distinct states: on and off. These states can be easily represented by 1s and 0s. This simplicity makes binary an ideal way to represent and process data electronically.

### Binary Basics

- **Bit:** The smallest unit of data in a computer, represented as a 0 or 1.
- **Byte:** A group of 8 bits. For example, the binary sequence 11001010 is one byte.
- **Binary to Decimal Conversion:** To convert binary to decimal, each bit is multiplied by 2 raised to the power of its position from right to left, starting at 0. For example:
  - Binary: 1101
  - Decimal: (1 * 2^3) + (1 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0) = 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13

### How to Convert Binary to Decimal

Converting binary to decimal involves understanding the place value of each bit. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Write down the binary number.** 
2. **List the powers of 2** from right to left starting at 2^0.
3. **Multiply each bit** by its corresponding power of 2.
4. **Sum the results** to get the decimal number.

**Example: Convert 1011 to decimal:**
- Binary: 1011
- Powers of 2: 2^3, 2^2, 2^1, 2^0
- Calculation: (1 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11
- Decimal: 11

### Binary Arithmetic

Binary arithmetic operates similarly to decimal arithmetic but with only two digits. Here are basic operations:

- **Addition:**
  - 0 + 0 = 0
  - 0 + 1 = 1
  - 1 + 0 = 1
  - 1 + 1 = 10 (which is 2 in decimal; the 1 is carried over)

**Example: Add 1101 and 1010:**

   1101
 + 1010
 ------
 10111

Here, you carry over the 1 in the third column from the right.

- **Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division:** These follow the same principles as in decimal but are based on binary rules.

### Practical Uses of Binary

1. **Data Representation:** All data in a computer, whether it be text, images, or videos, is ultimately represented in binary.
2. **Communication Protocols:** Networks use binary to encode data sent between computers.
3. **Logical Operations:** Binary is used in logical operations and conditions in programming and computer algorithms.

### Practice Set

1. Convert the following binary numbers to decimal:
   - 1010
   - 1111
   - 1001
2. Convert the following decimal numbers to binary:
   - 5
   - 14
   - 23
3. Perform binary addition:
   - 1101 + 1010
   - 1001 + 0110
